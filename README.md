# HMM

This repository contains a number of language models capable of part-of-speech tagging. 
The idea is to explore the design space around part-of-speech taggers for educational purposes. 

To use, go to mainScript, navigate to lines 14-17, and select the language model you would like to use. 

# Language Models
## Hidden Markov Model
A hidden markov model is used to perform part-of-speech tagging. 
## Hidden Markov Model Derivative
A model which is structurally similiar to the Hidden Markov Model is used. 
## Simple Product Maximization
A model which solves the same maximization problem as a Hidden Markov Model, but uses a different computational strategy. 
## Baseline Model
Applies the most frequently observed part-of-speech to any given word,.
